A.7.a.2 Portfolio Website One Likes

I like the social links are centered at bottom of page.
I like the 3 options on menu page for links to "About", "Contact" and "Home" pages.

A.7.a.3 Portfolio Website One Dislikes

I don't like the mouse pointer on the web page shape of dot within a circle.
I don't like the dark background.
I don't like how the text for the main links move around when the mouse hovers over it.
I don't like how the text for the social links at the bottom 
A few seconds delay in loading initial/landing page.
I don't like how text for links uses san serif but text for links to other portfolio pages uses serif.

A.7.a.4 Portfolio Website One Header

Found several containers for the header area but some were not labeled with any name similiar to "header", e.g., "menu" or "menu_footer"; a bit confusing.

A.7.a.5 Portfolio Website One Body

Found body and its many elements with "aside" elements.

A.7.a.6 Portfolio Website One Footer

Footer information didn't contain the social links I expected. An element in the body contain the social links.

A.7.b   Portfolio Website Two
A.7.b.1 Portfolio Website Two URL

https://jglover.space/

A.7.b.2 Portfolio Website Two Likes

Simple one page design that had links to external sites.

A.7.b.3 Portfolio Website Two Dislikes

I hate the monospaced font; looks odd to me.
I hate the black and purple color scheme; looks too dark and depressing.

A.7.b.4 Portfolio Website Two Header

Nav container is used for header to contain links to other web sites or to other sections on homepage.
Easily found head element with header content.

A.7.b.5 Portfolio Website Two Body

Body was clearly named and easy to find.

A.7.b.6 Portfolio Website Two Footer

Footer was clearly marked and easy to analyze.

A.7.c   Portfolio Website Three
A.7.c.1 Portfolio Website Three URL

http://www.benjohnsmith.com/

A.7.c.2 Portfolio Website Three Likes

Initial "preload" page  displays messages/sayings while web page is loading.
I like the "Josefin san" font used.

A.7.c.3 Portfolio Website Three Dislikes

Takes more than a few seconds to load; lots of images and other graphic elements must slow down loading.
I like the links at the top of header for sections of homepage.
Sometimes shows loading "quotes" without stopping; need to navigate to site with new tab if that happens.

A.7.c.4 Portfolio Website Three Header

Didn't find any "header" elements that were clearly labelled but the "navigation buttons" class seemed to act as part of header; maybe "fragment-head" class is the true header?

A.7.c.5 Portfolio Website Three Body

Body appears to be broken up into "fragment-*" classes that contain information like "Projects", "Interface" and "Web Design".

A.7.c.6 Portfolio Website Three Footer

"fragment-foot" class appears to be the footer that contains links to external social sites.
